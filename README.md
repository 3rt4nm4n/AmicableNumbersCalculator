# AmicableNumbersCalculator
#### Assume that a!=b
#### If d(a) = b and d(b) = a then a and b are amicable numbers which means if sum of proper divisors of a add up to b and if sum of proper divisors of b add up to a, then these are amicable
#### e.g. d(220)=284 & d(284)=220
#### Note that a and b cannot be same, a and b cannot be prime.
